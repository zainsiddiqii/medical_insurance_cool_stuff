This is my first portfolio project that analyses the medical insurance data of patients in the USA. This data is stored in the insurance.csv file. 
**I purposely do not use the pandas and NumPy libraries here simply to work on Python's built-in data structures. I use pandas and/or NumPy in other projects!

    "\n",
    "A proper analysis of medical insurance costs where I can use each variable given and obtain valuable insights for each, i.e. how they affect the cost of each individual. I can use some conditionals to obtain data for a certain age group or BMI group, for example. It will be vital to make multiple sorted list, where you can group data and display statistics for each group separately.\n",

    "### Importing data into useful format\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing as our data is arranged in tabular form in a csv file, we can use the `csv` library to get our data into dictionaries and then possibly lists so we have our data in a format that is easy to conduct analysis on.\n",

    "### EXAMPLE: Age category\n",
    "\n",
    "The age category is an interesing variable but will not tell much about the cost without the other factors, age combined with other factors will be an interesting variable to analyse. I will try to analyse data for 3 distinct groups, people below the age of 20 (called 'Zoomers'), people below the age of 40 (called 'Millenials'), people below the age of 65 (called 'Boomers')."
